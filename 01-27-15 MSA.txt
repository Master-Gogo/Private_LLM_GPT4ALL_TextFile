EXHIBIT A

CHANGE CONTROL PROCEDURE

The Parties agree to comply with the following change control procedures to revise, amend, alter or otherwise change

the services being provided under a SOW under this Agreement:

29

1. For purposes of this Exhibit, “Change” means any
changes to a SOW that is not within the scope of the
services under the SOW. To request a Change, either party
may deliver a written request (the “Change Request”) to
the other party that states, to the extent known: (i) the
proposed Change, (ii) the purpose of the Change, (iii) the
SOW provisions that are affected by the Change and (iv)
the effective date for the Change.

2. The Parties agree to discuss the scope and nature of the
Change Request. As soon as practicable and to the extent
applicable, Novitex will prepare and deliver to Customer a
written statement (the “Change Order’; a form of Change
Order is attached as an Exhibit hereto) describing any
changes in methodology, procedures, prioritization,
products, services, assignment of personnel and other
resources that Novitex believes would be required to
implement the Change. In addition, the Change Order will
include, as appropriate or applicable, (i) the net increase or
decrease in the pricing that would be applicable, (ii) a
description of how the proposed Change would be
implemented, (iii) the Performance Standards that would
apply to the Change, (iv) a description of the effect, if any,
such Change would have on the applicable SOW, (v) an
estimation of all resources required to implement such
Change, and (vi) any other information as may be relevant
to the proposed Change.

3. When both parties have agreed upon modifications
specified in the Change Order, the Change Order will be
signed by authorized representatives of both parties.
Novitex shall have no obligation to commence work in
connection with any Change Order before receiving the
appropriate approval from Customer. Each approved
Change Order as described above, shall be incorporated
into and constitute an amendment to the applicable SOW.

4, Notwithstanding the procedures above, if any Changes
are necessary to meet a critical requirement and it is not
reasonably practical to agree the contents of a Change Order
in advance, then (i) Customer shall notify Novitex via email
of the need for a critical Change (ii) Novitex shall notify
Customer of the cost of the change and, if it receives e-mail
confirmation to proceed, immediately or as soon as
practicable make that Change, (iii) Novitex will then
document the Change as soon as reasonably possible and
(iv) the parties shall use their respective reasonable efforts
to agree the relevant Change Order as soon as reasonably
possible on the basis that if the parties cannot agree that
Change Order within 30 days after it is submitted by
Novitex, then Novitex, without penalty, may cease
providing the Services that are the subject of the Change

Order.
